This repository is some part of my personal project [Bass Hug](https://www.bick.xyz/posts/bass-hug/). Bass Hug is a cushion device that vibrates to the bass sound of the music you are listening to and allows you to feel the vibration of the music while holding it. Inside the cushion, there are eight vibration motors.

This code allows Raspberry Pi to analyze the frequency of the song, and run the eight vibration motors to vibrate according to the magnitude of the bass sound, by default from 0-250Hz.
